<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The <strong>AI-Powered Content Moderation System</strong> is designed to analyze user-generated content and identify potentially discriminatory, biased, or unethical language. The system leverages OpenAI's large language models (LLM) to provide an in-depth analysis of text content, focusing on detecting and flagging various forms of bias, including racial, gender, religious, political, and general unethical behavior.</p>
    <p>This system is ideal for use in any platform or application that needs to monitor and moderate user-generated content to ensure that it aligns with ethical standards and inclusivity. The system provides a severity rating, an explanation of flagged content, and suggestions for improving content to be more inclusive and respectful.</p>

<h2>Why This Project?</h2>
    <p>The internet and digital spaces are increasingly becoming a hub for diverse conversations, making it essential to ensure that user-generated content is respectful, inclusive, and free from harmful biases. Many platforms, such as social media sites, forums, and content-sharing platforms, need automated solutions to help identify and mitigate hate speech, discrimination, and harmful language.</p>
    <p>The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use, efficient, and effective solution for flagging harmful content, using state-of-the-art AI models to assess content in real time. This will allow organizations to better monitor and manage their communities and ensure safer, more inclusive environments.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bias Detection</strong>: Identifies instances of racial, gender, religious, political bias, and general unethical behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Severity Rating</strong>: Provides a severity score from 1 to 10, where 1 represents minimal bias and 10 represents extreme bias.</li>
        <li><strong>Explanations and Suggestions</strong>: Offers detailed explanations for flagged content and provides suggested improvements for more inclusive language.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Input Formats</strong>: The system supports analyzing content from large text files, PDFs, CSV files, or even direct user input through copy-paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Excel Report</strong>: Generates a downloadable Excel report that lists flagged content along with its severity, category, explanation, and suggestions.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Text Input</strong>: The system processes text input from various sources like a CSV file, JSON file, or direct user input.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>AI Analysis</strong>: The OpenAI GPT-3 model is used to analyze the content and flag discriminatory or biased language.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Severity Rating</strong>: The system assigns a severity score based on the level of harmfulness in the content.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Explanations & Suggestions</strong>: For each flagged piece of content, a detailed explanation and suggestions for improving the text are provided.</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Excel Report</strong>: After analysis, an Excel report is generated, providing a structured output with all the flagged content and corresponding information.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>To use this system, you will need Python 3.x installed on your machine. You will also need to install the required dependencies.</p>
<h3>Steps to Set Up</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Clone the Repository</strong>:
            <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/arthvijay/ai-content-moderation-system.git
cd ai-content-moderation-system</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Set Up Virtual Environment</strong> (optional but recommended):
            <pre><code>python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Install Dependencies</strong>:
            <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Set Up OpenAI API Key</strong>:
            <p>Create an OpenAI account at <a href="https://beta.openai.com/signup/">OpenAI Signup</a>.</p>
            <p>Retrieve your API key from <a href="https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys">OpenAI API Keys</a>.</p>
            <p>Replace the <code>your_openai_api_key_here</code> in the code with your actual OpenAI API key.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Once the system is set up, you can start using it to analyze content.</p>

<h3>1. Analyzing Text Directly</h3>
    <p>To analyze content directly, call the <code>analyze_content()</code> function with the text you want to analyze. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>text = "Example of content to analyze."
result = analyze_content(text)
print(result)</code></pre>

<h3>2. Processing a CSV File</h3>
    <p>The system supports CSV files where each row contains a piece of text to be analyzed. The function <code>process_csv_input()</code> will read the CSV file, analyze the content, and generate an Excel report.</p>
    <pre><code>process_csv_input('input_data.csv')</code></pre>

<h3>3. Processing a JSON File</h3>
    <p>If you have a JSON file containing text data, use the <code>process_json_input()</code> function to analyze the content.</p>
    <pre><code>process_json_input('input_data.json')</code></pre>

<h3>4. Paste Content Directly</h3>
    <p>If you want to paste text for analysis, simply call the <code>analyze_content()</code> function as shown in the direct text example above.</p>

<h3>5. Generating Reports</h3>
    <p>After the analysis, the system will generate an <code>output_report.xlsx</code> file containing the flagged content, severity scores, explanations, and suggested improvements.</p>

<h2>Example Output</h2>
    <p>The output will be an Excel file where each row corresponds to a piece of flagged content, with the following columns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Content</strong>: The original text.</li>
        <li><strong>Severity</strong>: The severity score of the content.</li>
        <li><strong>Category</strong>: The type of bias detected (e.g., racial, gender, political, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Explanation</strong>: A detailed explanation of why the content was flagged.</li>
        <li><strong>Suggestions</strong>: Suggested improvements to make the content more inclusive and respectful.</li>
    </ul>
